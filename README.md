First of all, it should be noted that the calculation of time and space complexity is impossible, but we can minimize it in certain cases. In this project, results are obtained with necessary algorithms through indexes. You can do the calculation like this:
1 - Write your code to the code.txt file in the file.
2 - Compile and Run ! :)


Attention,
